      "“Ikea uses ‘Spain-Mainland’ and ‘Spain-Balearics and Canary Islands’ [on its materials],” the report said, adding that the retailer should take the same approach to Taiwan and Hong Kong.\n",
      "Another said: “Ikea has always separated Taiwan and Hong Kong from China in its product tags and on its website … Ikea must correct this.”Ikea did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n",
      "In April, international airlines with mainland routes were told to stop listing Taiwan as a country on their websites and instead refer to it as “Taiwan, China” or the “China Taiwan region” or face punitive measures – demands the White House described as “Orwellian nonsense”.\n",
